# Bike Sales Project
#### Completed by: Niko Seino
#### Analysis Tool: Google Sheets

### Summary
For this project, I analyzed a bike company's data to answer the question: What can we learn about the customers who are purchasing bikes?

### Data Cleaning
Data was cleaned using tools including: removing duplicates, find and replace, and formatting.
I created a column using a conditional formula to summarize the 'Age' column for ease of analysis

### Analysis
Four pivot tables were created to help identify trends in the data, including: relationship between income and bikes purchased, commute distance and bikes purchased, and age and bikes purchased. 

### Visualization
Pivot tables were formatted into a dashboard so stakeholders could easily view the information in one place.
